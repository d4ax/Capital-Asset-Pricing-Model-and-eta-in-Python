This project aims to perform comprehensive stock analysis using Python, focusing on calculating stock betas and expected returns through the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for companies such as Facebook, Netflix, Twitter, and AT&T over the past seven years. 
The application of CAPM is crucial in finance as it establishes the relationship between an asset's expected return and its systematic risk.
By accurately estimating potential returns and associated risks, investors can make informed decisions when managing their portfolios, identifying market trends, and drawing valuable insights. 
This methodology can also be utilized for analyzing other assets such as indices or currencies and measuring portfolio efficiency.



-Implement necessary libraries, load datasets, and carry out initial data examination (exploratory data analysis).

-Gain comprehension of the conceptual basis and underlying intuition of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

-Create interactive plots utilizing Plotly Express.

-Compute Beta and anticipated returns for securities via Python.

-Theoretical background and intuitive understanding of CAPM.

-Design a Python-based function to determine the daily returns of securities.

-Execute data scaling or normalization processes.
