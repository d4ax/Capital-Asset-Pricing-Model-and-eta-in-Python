# Comprehensive Stock Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview
This project aims to perform comprehensive stock analysis using Python, focusing on calculating stock betas and expected returns through the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for companies such as Facebook, Netflix, Twitter, and AT&T over the past seven years. The CAPM is a fundamental model in finance that links an asset's expected return to its systematic risk, enabling investors to make informed decisions by accurately estimating potential returns and associated risks. This methodology is not only applicable to stocks but can also be extended to other assets such as indices or currencies, and for measuring portfolio efficiency.

### Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Implement necessary libraries, load datasets, and conduct initial data examination.
- **CAPM Understanding:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of the Capital Asset Pricing Model and its underlying intuition.
- **Interactive Plots:** Create interactive plots using Plotly Express to visualize data in an engaging manner.
- **Beta and Expected Returns Calculation:** Compute Beta and anticipated returns for securities using Python.
- **Daily Returns Calculation:** Design a Python-based function to determine the daily returns of securities.
- **Data Normalization:** Execute data scaling or normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
