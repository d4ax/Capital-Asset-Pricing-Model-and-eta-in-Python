In this undertaking, we'll utilize Python to execute stock analysis, including the computation of stock betas and anticipated returns utilizing the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). 
The CAPM represents a significant model in Finance that outlines the connection between the anticipated yield and risk of financial instruments. 
Our examination will focus on multiple organizations, namely Facebook, Netflix, Twitter, and AT&T, spanning the previous 7-year period. 
This venture holds immense significance for investors aiming to effectively administer their portfolios, estimate projected returns and risks, illustrate data sets, detect meaningful trends, and derive insightful conclusions. 
This initiative can be applied practically for evaluating various entities like stocks, indices, or currencies and assessing portfolio performance.
